 Extracting pdfs from archive(zip, rar) and combine them

## Why?
 So at my job, we have consignments as pdfs, we use some telegram bot to combine them as 16 pdf on one page, and it takes like 7 to 15 minutes everyday to combine 80 to 110 pdfs, and up 20 at mondays as amount of consignments grow up to 200. And one day i choose to solve it.
 So yeah this is it. It can do 600 pdfs at one minute(on my machine!), and can do it at variant page sizes from A0-A8 and of course any amount elements at page, wanna 10 pdfs on every page? no problem! wanna 15? 25? 50?! 100?! NO PROBLEM!
## Usage
 So for example we have this pdf
